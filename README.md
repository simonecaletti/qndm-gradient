# Quantum Non Demolition Measurement (QNDM) algorithm for gradient evaluation

Official repository for the QNDM algorithm described in [arXiv:2301.07128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07128).
The QNDM algorithm allows to compute the gradient (and higher derivatives) of a function embedded in a quantum circuit. It is particularly useful in the context of Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA).
The standard method to compute derivative is the so-called Direct Measurement algorithm [arXiv:2008.06517](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06517) which is the default options in the most popular QC libraries.
